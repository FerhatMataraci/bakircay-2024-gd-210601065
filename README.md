MIDTERM

Objective

The objective of this project is to create a simple 3D interactive game where players can pick up, move, and place objects within a defined area. The game features dynamic interactions such as object placement, ejection for excess objects, and a pause menu for restarting or navigating to the main menu.

Preventing Extra Objects

This video demonstrates how the platform prevents additional objects from being placed when it already holds one. Extra objects are ejected forcefully to maintain a single-object rule on the platform, ensuring gameplay balance and functionality.

Pause Menu

The pause menu provides essential controls during gameplay. Players can restart the game to begin again or return to the main menu to exit the current session and navigate to the game's starting screen.
