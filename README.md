Objective

The objective of this project is to create a simple 3D interactive game where players can pick up, move, and place objects within a defined area. The game features dynamic interactions such as object placement, ejection for excess objects, and a pause menu for restarting or navigating to the main menu.

Preventing Extra Objects

This video demonstrates how the platform prevents additional objects from being placed when it already holds one. Extra objects are ejected forcefully to maintain a single-object rule on the platform, ensuring gameplay balance and functionality.

Release

The release button allows the player to remove the currently placed object from the platform

Pause Menu

The pause menu provides essential controls during gameplay. Players can restart the game to begin again or return to the main menu to exit the current session and navigate to the game's starting screen.

FINAL

Game Objective

In this single-player matching game, the player is tasked with matching pairs of objects scattered across a platform. The objective is to identify and pair up matching objects from a pile, clearing the platform of all matching pairs. The game continues until there are no remaining matching objects on the stage.

Object Matching System

1. Correct Object Matching

This video demonstrates a successful matching of objects on the platform. When two objects with the same match attribute are placed, the system identifies them as correct matches. As a result, the matched objects are removed, and the player's score increases, rewarding them for the accurate match.

2. Incorrect Object Matching

This video showcases what happens when two objects with mismatched attributes are placed on the platform. The system detects the mismatch and ejects the objects off the platform, simulating a rejection

3. Preventing Extra Objects

This video demonstrates how the platform system prevents additional objects from entering once the platform is already occupied by two objects. Extra objects are ejected automatically to maintain the system's functionality and prevent overcrowding.
