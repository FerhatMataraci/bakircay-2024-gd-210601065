Game Objective

In this single-player matching game, the player is tasked with matching pairs of objects scattered across a platform. The objective is to identify and pair up matching objects from a pile, clearing the platform of all matching pairs. The game continues until there are no remaining matching objects on the stage.

Object Matching System

1. Correct Object Matching

This video demonstrates a successful matching of objects on the platform. When two objects with the same match attribute are placed, the system identifies them as correct matches. As a result, the matched objects are removed, and the player's score increases, rewarding them for the accurate match.

2. Incorrect Object Matching

This video showcases what happens when two objects with mismatched attributes are placed on the platform. The system detects the mismatch and ejects the objects off the platform, simulating a rejection

3. Preventing Extra Objects

This video demonstrates how the platform system prevents additional objects from entering once the platform is already occupied by two objects. Extra objects are ejected automatically to maintain the system's functionality and prevent overcrowding.
